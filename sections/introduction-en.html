    Despite the critical role of standards in the construction industry, their adoption is hindered by accessibility challenges, natural language complexity, and a lack of machine-readable formats. The <strong>BIM Landscape Standards Explorer</strong> initiative by the M&S committee aimed to address parts of these issues. The BIM Landscape Standards Explorer is connected to a carefully analysed and curated dataset of BIM standards and their metadata, shaped significantly over the past couple of years. 
</p>

<p>
    However, the data was structured in a relational database on one hand. On the other hand, the data was not machine-readable, not connected to other datasets, and not easily queryable despite being publicly available.
</p>

<h3>The MnS Ontology Aims To:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Provide a formal, semantic structure for BIM-related standards, although it can also be adapted for other domains.</li>
    <li>Facilitate querying and exploration of BIM and related standards' metadata and relationships.</li>
    <li>Promote interoperability and integration of standards with other datasets.</li>
    <li>Establish a link between the metadata of standards and existing ontologies in the construction domain.</li>
    <li>In the long term, the MnS Ontology aims to bridge the <strong>BIM Standards Landscape Explorer</strong> data and tool with the <strong>Built Environment Lookup Service (BE-OLS)</strong>, which is also developed by the M&S committee.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    While MnS extends the foundational work of the <strong>EC3 BIM Standards Landscape Explorer</strong> by enabling the development of an OWL-based representation of the dataset, it also bridges the gap between natural language documentation of standards and machine-readable, queryable representations.
</p>

<p>
    In essence, the MnS ontology reuses other ontologies when possible. The intention was to add value by focusing on how the data makes sense to practitioners in the built environment when they need to use a BIM standard, rather than simply making an ontology to convert standards metadata into a machine-readable format. 
</p>

<p>
    Therefore, the MnS ontology makes BIM standards data and metadata <strong>findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR)</strong>. The rationale behind developing an ontology was to:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Enable our existing relational dataset to become a knowledge graph that is easily accessible and linked to existing data on the Web.</li>
    <li>Allow others to understand and query our data to advance their work in using BIM and digital construction standards.</li>
</ol>
