    Despite the critical role of standards in the construction industry, their adoption is hindered by accessibility challenges, natural language complexity, and a lack of machine-readable formats. The <strong>BIM Landscape Standards Explorer</strong> initiative by the M&S committee aimed to address parts of these issues. The BIM Landscape Standards Explorer is connected to a carefully analysed and curated dataset of BIM standards and their metadata, shaped significantly over the past couple of years.

    However, the data was structured in a relational database on one hand. On the other hand, the data was not machine-readable, not connected to other datasets, and not easily queryable despite being publicly available.

<h3>The MnS Ontology Aims To:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Provide a formal, semantic structure for BIM-related standards, although it can also be adapted for other domains.</li>
    <li>Facilitate querying and exploration of BIM and related standards' metadata and relationships.</li>
    <li>Promote interoperability and integration of standards with other datasets.</li>
    <li>Establish a link between the metadata of standards and existing ontologies in the construction domain.</li>
    <li>In the long term, the MnS Ontology aims to bridge the <strong>BIM Standards Landscape Explorer</strong> data and tool with the <strong>Built Environment Lookup Service (BE-OLS)</strong>, which is also developed by the M&S committee.</li>
</ul>
